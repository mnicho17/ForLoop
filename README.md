Module 5 Discussion: for loop
Module 5 is entitled: "Loops".

Consider the code that is in page 164 , Listing 5.4, SubtractionQuizLoop.java file.

Consider at line 12 the "while loop" that is in code:

while (count < NUMBER_OF_QUESTIONS) {

Your task is to replace the "while loop" with a "for loop".

Remember to follow the format of a "for loop" as below:

for(int var=0;var<value;++var){

// existing code goes here

}

In order to do the task, first comment out the old code of the "while loop" and anything associated with it.

Write your own "for loop" code that will produce the same result as the "while loop". Verify that your code produces the same result. If your code does not produce the same result I will take points away.

Save your code and submit the java file under your: lastname_firstname_SubtractionQuizLoop.java
